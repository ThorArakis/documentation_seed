# All supporting documents / diagrams.
At the very least each service should contain the example documents in this folder. However any other service level documentation should live here too. IE:
- service flow diagrams *(which services does it interact with)*
- model diagrams if very complex
- tips/tricks for extra setup (like how to set up sublime with auto linting)
- hilarious pictures of your 30 cats
- lists that have at least 5 items
